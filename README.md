# Mayan Jump 2 — Web Port

**▶ [Play now](https://mayan-web.vercel.app)**

Web port of **Mayan Jump 2**, a 3D endless jumper game extracted from the last public Android APK (2018) by BadDog Game. The game was unlisted from the Play Store and development stopped. This port preserves the original game logic and assets, running directly in a browser using WebGL.

## Quick Start

Serve the directory with any HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in a browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## How It Works

The original game was built with **LayaAir v2.1.3.1** and wrapped in **LayaNative** (Conch) for Android. The APK was essentially a web app in a native shell. This port removes the native wrapper and runs the game directly in the browser.

## Engine Patches

Two bugs in the LayaAir engine were fixed to make the game work correctly on desktop browsers:

### 1. Portrait Aspect Ratio (`fix-aspect-ratio.js`)

The engine uses `window.innerWidth/innerHeight` to size the WebGL framebuffer. On desktop (landscape viewport ~16:9), this creates a landscape-shaped canvas that clips the portrait game (750×1334). **Fix:** Override `Browser.clientWidth/clientHeight` to return portrait-proportioned values that fit within the viewport while maintaining the 750:1334 ratio.

### 2. Mouse Coordinate Mapping (`fix-aspect-ratio.js`)

The engine's `_canvasTransform.invertTransformPoint()` converts viewport mouse coordinates to design coordinates but doesn't account for the canvas element's position when it's not at viewport (0,0). **Fix:** Patch the transform to subtract `getBoundingClientRect()` offset, correcting hit-testing when the game is centered on screen.

## Browser Compatibility

Tested on iPhone 16 (iOS 18) and desktop (macOS).

| Browser | Platform | Centered | Fits viewport | Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|---------------|-------|
| Safari | iOS | ✅ | ✅ | Perfect — fills width and height |
| Opera | iOS | ✅ | ✅ | Perfect — fills width and height |
| Arc Search | iOS | ✅ | ✅ | Perfect — fills width and height |
| Chrome | iOS | ✅ | ❌ | Centered but has black margins left and right |
| Firefox | iOS | ✅ | ❌ | Centered but has black margins left and right |
| Chrome | desktop | ✅ | ❌ | Centered, letterboxed on wide screens |
| Firefox | desktop | ✅ | ❌ | Centered, letterboxed on wide screens |
| Safari | desktop | ✅ | ❌ | Centered, letterboxed on wide screens |

**Known issue:** Chrome iOS and Firefox iOS don't fill the viewport width, leaving thin black bars on the sides. This is due to how these browsers report `innerWidth` vs the actual visual viewport width. Safari, Opera, and Arc Search handle this correctly. Pull requests welcome.

## Known Limitations

- **Background music**: Not present in the APK assets (likely handled by the Android native layer)
- **Ads, ranking, video rewards**: Android-specific features stubbed out via `conch-shim.js`
- **Audio autoplay**: Chrome blocks audio until first user interaction; LayaAir auto-recovers on click
- **Font**: The 10MB `layabox.ttf` is included for Chinese text rendering; English-only users could omit it

## Gameplay

- **Resolution**: 750×1334 portrait
- **Controls**: Tap and drag left/right to rotate the cylinder. Player auto-jumps on blocks.
- **Mechanics**: Combo system, fire/power mode (combo ≥ 3), walls (instant death), trap blocks
- **Scenes**: Home → Game → Revive/Settle dialogs
